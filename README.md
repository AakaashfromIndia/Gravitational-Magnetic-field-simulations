Overview: 
This repository contains a Python program that simulates a gravitational field using the Pygame library. The simulation consists of randomly moving particles influenced by gravitational forces generated by masses placed on the screen.

Parts:
1) Particle Class: Simulates randomly moving particles with gravitational interactions.
2) Mass Class: Represents masses that exert gravitational forces and grow in size and intensity.
3) GravitationalField Class: Manages the particles and masses, applying gravitational forces between them.
4) Random Particle Generation: New particles are randomly generated over time.
5) Mass Placement: Masses can be placed on the screen by clicking the left mouse button, influencing nearby particles.

Prerequisites:
Python (any version)
Pygame library (use pip install pygame to install)
Acknowledgments
The simulation is inspired by gravitational physics principles.
Pygame library for providing a simple interface for creating games and simulations in Python.
Feel free to explore and experiment with the simulation! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
